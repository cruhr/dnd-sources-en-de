# D&D 5e Sources English & German

This project contains all items, monsters and spells from the D&D 5e SRD5.1 in English and German in JSON format.  
The translations to German are not the official translations. They have been created with DeepL and have been edited manually to be used in various tools on https://mythical.ink.  
Once again: **Those are not the official translations and they are most likely not 100% accurate.**

This repository includes some homebrew items as well which fall under the same license (see below).

## Contribution

Monsters, Spells and Items from other official D&D source books which don't fall under the CC-BY-4.0 license can not be merged to this repositories.
